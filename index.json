LCANet fuses data from LiDAR sensors and cameras by projecting image features into the 3D space, integrating semantic information into the point cloud data. This fused data is then encoded to produce 3D features that contain both semantic and spatial information, which are further refined to reconstruct final points before bounding box prediction. This fusion effectively compensates for LiDAR's weakness in detecting objects at long distances, which are often represented by sparse points. Additionally, due to the sparsity of many objects in the original dataset, which makes effective supervision for point generation challenging, we employ a point cloud completion network to create a complete point cloud dataset that supervises the generation of dense point clouds in our network.

To solve this problem, we propose a teacher-student learning approach. Here, the teacher model utilizes actual future poses of other agents to determine which agents should be focused on for the final prediction. This attentional knowledge guides the student model in determining which agents to focus on and how much attention to allocate when predicting future trajectories. Additionally, we introduce a Lane-guided Attention Module (LAM) that considers interactions with local lanes near predicted trajectories to enhance prediction performance. This module is integrated into the student model to refine agent features, thereby facilitating a more accurate emulation of the teacher model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model with a large-scale Argoverse motion forecasting dataset, improving overall prediction performance.

Specifically, we propose a last frame-aware diffusion process to preserve visual coherence between consecutive videos where each video consists of different events by initializing the latent and simultaneously adjusting noise in the latent to enhance the motion dynamic in a generated video. Furthermore, we find that the iterative update of latent vectors by referring to all the preceding frames maintains the global appearance across the frames in a video clip.

Established trajectory prediction methods primarily use agent tracks generated by a detection and tracking system and HD map as inputs. In this work, we propose a novel method that also incorporates visual input from surround-view cameras, allowing the model to utilize visual cues such as human gazes and gestures, road conditions, vehicle turn signals, etc, which are typically hidden from the model in prior methods. Furthermore, we use textual descriptions generated by a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and refined by a Large Language Model (LLM) as supervision during training to guide the model on what to learn from the input data. Despite using these extra inputs, our method achieves a latency of 53 ms, making it feasible for real-time processing, which is significantly faster than that of previous single-agent prediction methods with similar performance. Our experiments show that both the visual inputs and the textual descriptions contribute to improvements in trajectory prediction performance, and our qualitative analysis highlights how the model is able to exploit these additional inputs. Lastly, in this work we create and release the nuScenes-Text dataset, which augments the established nuScenes dataset with rich textual annotations for every scene, demonstrating the positive impact of utilizing VLM on trajectory prediction.

To address this, we advocate for supervising a model to predict objects' poses given past observations, thus explicitly guiding to learn objects' temporal cues. To this end, we propose a model called DAP (Detection After Prediction), consisting of a two branch network (i) a branch responsible for forecasting the current objects’ poses given past observations and (ii) another branch that detects objects based on the current and past observations. The features predicting the current objects from branch (i) is fused into branch (ii) to transfer predictive knowledge.

However, we observe that such text inputs are often bottlenecked in providing and synthesizing rich semantic cues, e.g., differentiating heavy rain from rain with thunderstorms. To address this issue, we advocate leveraging an additional modality, sound, which has notable advantages in image manipulation as it can convey more diverse semantic cues (vivid emotions or dynamic expressions of the natural world) than texts.

However, complex modeling is used to predict the relationship between objects, and the inherent relationship between object queries learned in the multi-head self-attention of the object detector has been neglected. We propose a lightweight one-stage SGG model that extracts the relation graph from the various relationships learned in the multi-head self-attention layers of the DETR decoder. By fully utilizing the self-attention by-products, the relation graph can be extracted effectively with a shallow relation extraction head. Considering the dependency of the relation extraction task on the object detection task, we propose a novel relation smoothing technique that adjusts the relation label adaptively according to the quality of the detected objects. By the relation smoothing, the model is trained according to the continuous curriculum that focuses on object detection task at the beginning of training and performs multi-task learning as the object detection performance gradually improves. Furthermore, we propose a connectivity prediction task that predicts whether a relation exists between object pairs as an auxiliary task of the relation extraction.

Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained classification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.","tags":[],"title":"An Embedding-Dynamic Approach to Self-supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daeun Lee","Jongwon Park","Jinkyu Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"8bdd47e50b221827fdf2e0a943c137dd","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/lidar_wacv2023/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lidar_wacv2023/","section":"publication","summary":"An autonomous driving system requires a 3D object detector, which must perceive all present road agents reliably to navigate an environment safely.

Recent work manipulates an original masterpiece to integrate semantic understanding from audio source through audio-visual correlation learning. In previous works, researchers proposed audio-reactive interpolation method based on musical features and latent transfer mapping of deep music embeddings to style embeddings for video/image generation. However, previous approaches mainly utilized features and attributes of music, which were hard to convey semantically meaningful image manipulation from given audio source. We propose extending the domain of StyleCLIP to audio in order to overcome abovementioned limitation. StyleCLIP carried out text-based image manipulation by mapping latent feature of text to that of image. In our case, we replace text with audio to design audio-based semantic image manipulation.

The research field to solve this problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require sampling of the negative data pair. However, the performance of contrastive learning fundamentally depends on quality and quantity of negative data pairs. To address this issue, we propose a new regularization method for domain generalization based on contrastive learning, self-supervised contrastive regularization (SelfReg). The proposed approach use only positive data pairs, thus it resolves various problems caused by negative pair sampling. Moreover, we propose a class-specific domain perturbation layer (CDPL), which makes it possible to effectively apply mixup augmentation even when only positive data pairs are used.

(i) a Brownian diffusive loss, which induces a Brownian motion in the embedding space so that embeddings are uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere. (ii) A multi-view centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull together multiple augmented representations of the same image into the geometric centroid. (iii) A whitening loss, which decorrelates the different feature dimensions in the latent space. We evaluate BMWReg on two visual benchmarks -- ImageNet-100 and STL-10. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.","tags":[],"title":"BMWReg: Brownian-diffusive, Multiview, Whitening Regulararizations for Self-supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinkyu Kim","Mayank Bansal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"7ec3ebfc6af0decc8b073c2da042cfcc","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/attnbot/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/attnbot/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks are a key component of behavior prediction and motion generation for self-driving cars. One of their main drawbacks is a lack of transparency -- they should provide easy to interpret rationales for what triggers certain behaviors. We propose an architecture called Attentional Bottleneck with the goal of improving transparency. Our key idea is to combine visual attention, which identifies what aspects of the input the model is using, with an information bottleneck that enables the model to only use aspects of the input which are important. This not only provides sparse and interpretable attention maps (e.g. focusing only on specific vehicles in the scene), but it adds this transparency at no cost to model accuracy. In fact, we find improvements in accuracy when applying Attentional Bottleneck to the ChauffeurNet model, whereas we find that the accuracy deteriorates with a traditional visual attention model.","tags":[],"title":"Towards an Interpretable Deep Driving Network by Attentional Bottleneck","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
