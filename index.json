A somewhat bewildering variety of techniques have been used, not always with a clear understanding of the reasons for their benefits, especially when used in combination. Here we treat the embeddings of images as point particles and consider model optimization as a dynamic process on this system of particles. Our dynamic model combines an attractive force for similar images, a locally dispersive force to avoid local collapse, and a global dispersive force to achieve a globally-homogeneous distribution of particles. The dynamic perspective highlights the advantage of using a delayed-parameter image embedding (a la BYOL) together with multiple views of the same image. It also uses a purely-dynamic local dispersive force (Brownian motion) that shows improved performance over other methods and does not require knowledge of other particle coordinates. The method is called MSBReg which stands for (i) a Multiview centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull different image view embeddings toward their centroid, (ii) a Singular value loss, which pushes the particle system toward spatially homogeneous density, (iii) a Brownian diffusive loss. We evaluate downstream classification performance of MSBReg on ImageNet as well as transfer learning tasks including fine-grained classification, multi-class object classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.","tags":[],"title":"An Embedding-Dynamic Approach to Self-supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daeun Lee","Jongwon Park","Jinkyu Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666396800,"objectID":"8bdd47e50b221827fdf2e0a943c137dd","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/lidar_wacv2023/","publishdate":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lidar_wacv2023/","section":"publication","summary":"An autonomous driving system requires a 3D object detector, which must perceive all present road agents reliably to navigate an environment safely.

In this work, we propose a method to address this data imbalance problem. Our method consists of two main components (i) a LiDAR-based 3D object detector with per-class multiple detection heads where losses from each head are modified by dynamic weight average to be balanced. (ii) Contextual ground truth (GT) sampling, where we improve conventional GT sampling techniques by leveraging semantic information to augment point cloud with sampled ground truth GT objects.

To mitigate this issue, we propose using the following two main modules (1) Stereo Disparity Estimation for Weak Depth Supervision and (2) Adversarial Overlap Region Discriminator. The former utilizes the traditional stereo disparity estimation method to obtain reliable disparity information from the overlap region. Given the disparity estimates as supervision, we propose regularizing the network to fully utilize the geometric potential of binocular images and improve the overall detection accuracy accordingly.

To address this issue, we first apply existing domain generalization (DG) techniques, which, however, produce less compelling desaturated images due to the network’s over-emphasis on learning domain-invariant contents (or shapes). Thus, we propose a new domain generalizable colorization model, which consists of two modules (i) a domain-invariant content-biased feature encoder and (ii) a source-domain-specific color generator. To mitigate the issue of insufficient source domain-specific color information in domain-invariant features, we propose a skip connection that can transfer content feature statistics via adaptive instance normalization. Our experiments with publicly available PACS and Office-Home DG benchmarks confirm that our model is indeed able to produce perceptually reasonable colorized images.

In contrast to realism, non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) area, in particular, has focused on creating artificial style rendering for painting, drawing, and cartoon. With the advanced development of generative models, impressive computer-generated paintings based on artistic style learning approach have been appeared. On the other hand, researchers started to propose methods to produce creative painting beyond simply adopting the artistic style from other masterpieces. This includes utilizing auditory and visual sources to manipulate original masterpiece with novel style. Recent work manipulates an original masterpiece to integrate semantic understanding from audio source through audio-visual correlation learning. In previous works, researchers proposed audio-reactive interpolation method based on musical features and latent transfer mapping of deep music embeddings to style embeddings for video/image generation. However, previous approaches mainly utilized features and attributes of music, which were hard to convey semantically meaningful image manipulation from given audio source. We propose extending the domain of StyleCLIP to audio in order to overcome abovementioned limitation. StyleCLIP carried out text-based image manipulation by mapping latent feature of text to that of image. In our case, we replace text with audio to design audio-based semantic image manipulation. In particular, we encode both audio and image into the same latent space. This allows us maximizing advantages of both CLIP (effective representation of similarity) and StyleGAN (high-quality image generation).

We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we observe our sound-guided image manipulation approach can produce semantically meaningful images.","tags":[],"title":"Sound-guided Semantic Image Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daehee Kim","Jinkyu Kim","Jaekoo Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"c02ae23c87d4bd61c19f5b6c94d2e192","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/ictexpress/","publishdate":"2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ictexpress/","section":"publication","summary":"Domain generalization aims to learn a domain-invariant representation from multiple source domains so that a model can generalize well across unseen target domains. Such models are often trained with examples that are presented randomly from all source domains, which can make the training unstable due to optimization in conflicting gradient directions. Here, we explore inter-domain curriculum learning (IDCL) where source domains are exposed in a meaningful order to gradually provide more complex ones. The experiments show that significant improvements can be achieved in both PACS and O ce-Home benchmarks, and ours improves the state-of-the-art method by 1.08%.","tags":[],"title":"Inter-domain curriculum learning for domain generalization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daehee Kim","Seunghyun Park","Jinkyu Kim","Jaekoo Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1634688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1634688000,"objectID":"7ceee7b03d0fd7941b8af83c08b94b0c","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/selfreg/","publishdate":"2020-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/selfreg/","section":"publication","summary":"In general, an experimental environment for deep learning assumes that the training and the test dataset are sampled from the same distribution. However, in real-world situations, a difference in the distribution between two datasets, domain shift, may occur, which becomes a major factor impeding the generalization performance of the model. The research field to solve this problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require sampling of the negative data pair. However, the performance of contrastive learning fundamentally depends on quality and quantity of negative data pairs. To address this issue, we propose a new regularization method for domain generalization based on contrastive learning, self-supervised contrastive regularization (SelfReg). The proposed approach use only positive data pairs, thus it resolves various problems caused by negative pair sampling. Moreover, we propose a class-specific domain perturbation layer (CDPL), which makes it possible to effectively apply mixup augmentation even when only positive data pairs are used. The experimental results show that the techniques incorporated by SelfReg contributed to the performance in a compatible manner. In the recent benchmark, DomainBed, the proposed method shows comparable performance to the conventional state-of-the-art alternatives.

Using positive pairs may avoid dealing with computationally demanding negatives, but so-called mode collapse may occur without any implicit biases in the learning architecture. In this paper, we propose a new loss function, called BMWReg, which induces an implicit contrastive effect in the embedding space, effectively preventing a mode collapse. BMWReg consists of the following three regularization terms. (i) a Brownian diffusive loss, which induces a Brownian motion in the embedding space so that embeddings are uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere. (ii) A multi-view centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull together multiple augmented representations of the same image into the geometric centroid. (iii) A whitening loss, which decorrelates the different feature dimensions in the latent space. We evaluate BMWReg on two visual benchmarks -- ImageNet-100 and STL-10. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.","tags":[],"title":"BMWReg: Brownian-diffusive, Multiview, Whitening Regulararizations for Self-supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinkyu Kim","Mayank Bansal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"7ec3ebfc6af0decc8b073c2da042cfcc","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/attnbot/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/attnbot/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks are a key component of behavior prediction and motion generation for self-driving cars. One of their main drawbacks is a lack of transparency -- they should provide easy to interpret rationales for what triggers certain behaviors. We propose an architecture called Attentional Bottleneck with the goal of improving transparency. Our key idea is to combine visual attention, which identifies what aspects of the input the model is using, with an information bottleneck that enables the model to only use aspects of the input which are important. This not only provides sparse and interpretable attention maps (e.g. focusing only on specific vehicles in the scene), but it adds this transparency at no cost to model accuracy. In fact, we find improvements in accuracy when applying Attentional Bottleneck to the ChauffeurNet model, whereas we find that the accuracy deteriorates with a traditional visual attention model.","tags":[],"title":"Towards an Interpretable Deep Driving Network by Attentional Bottleneck","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
