Being able to incorporate human knowledge of typical causal driving behaviour should benefit autonomous systems. We propose a new approach that learns vehicle control with the help of human advice. Specifically, our system learns to summarize its visual observations in natural language, predict an appropriate action response (e.g. \"I see a pedestrian crossing, so I stop\"), and predict the controls, accordingly. Moreover, to enhance interpretability of our system, we introduce a fine-grained attention mechanism which relies on semantic segmentation and object-centric RoI pooling. We show that our approach of training the autonomous system with human advice, grounded in a rich semantic representation, matches or outperforms prior work in terms of control prediction and explanation generation. Our approach also results in more interpretable visual explanations by visualizing object-centric attention maps. We evaluate our approach on a novel driving dataset with ground-truth human explanations, the Berkeley DeepDrive eXplanation (BDD-X) dataset.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Explainable and Advisable Model for Self-driving Cars","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francis Indaheng","Edward Kim","Kesav Viswanadha","Jay Shenoy","Jinkyu Kim","Daniel J.

Forecasting the future trajectories of nearby agents plays a critical role in ensuring road safety, as it equips AVs with the necessary information to plan safe routes of travel. However, these prediction models are data-driven and trained on data collected in real life that may not represent the full range of scenarios an AV can encounter. Hence, it is important that these prediction models are extensively tested in various test scenarios involving interactive behaviors prior to deployment. To support this need, we present a simulation-based testing platform that supports (1) intuitive scenario modeling with a probabilistic programming language called SCENIC, (2) specifying a multi-objective evaluation metric with a partial priority ordering, (3) falsification of the provided metric, and (4) parallelization of simulations for scalable testing. As a part of the platform, we provide a library of 25 SCENIC programs that model challenging test scenarios involving interactive traffic participant behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the scalability of our platform by testing a trained behavior prediction model and searching for failure scenarios.","tags":[],"title":"A Scenario-Based Platform for Testing Autonomous Vehicle Behavior Prediction Models in Simulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seung Hyun Lee","Nahyuk Lee","Chanyoung Kim","Wonjeong Ryoo","Jinkyu Kim","Sang Ho Yoon","Sangpil Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"fe64960ccc3e15bf3b05f245bc51af91","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/sound2image/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sound2image/","section":"publication","summary":"There has been a long attempt to transfer the field of art such as painting to computer-based creation. In contrast to realism, non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) area, in particular, has focused on creating artificial style rendering for painting, drawing, and cartoon. With the advanced development of generative models, impressive computer-generated paintings based on artistic style learning approach have been appeared. On the other hand, researchers started to propose methods to produce creative painting beyond simply adopting the artistic style from other masterpieces. This includes utilizing auditory and visual sources to manipulate original masterpiece with novel style. Recent work manipulates an original masterpiece to integrate semantic understanding from audio source through audio-visual correlation learning. In previous works, researchers proposed audio-reactive interpolation method based on musical features and latent transfer mapping of deep music embeddings to style embeddings for video/image generation. However, previous approaches mainly utilized features and attributes of music, which were hard to convey semantically meaningful image manipulation from given audio source. We propose extending the domain of StyleCLIP to audio in order to overcome abovementioned limitation. StyleCLIP carried out text-based image manipulation by mapping latent feature of text to that of image. In our case, we replace text with audio to design audio-based semantic image manipulation. In particular, we encode both audio and image into the same latent space. This allows us maximizing advantages of both CLIP (effective representation of similarity) and StyleGAN (high-quality image generation). In this work, we introduce semantic audio-reactive painting generation model. We believe that our proposal has a high potential in creation of new field of computer art by narrowing down the gap between music and art, which were regarded as different fields of art.","tags":[],"title":"Audio-Semantic Image Synthesis for Artistic Paintings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Seung Hyun Lee","Sang Ho Yoon","Jinkyu Kim","Sangpil Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638316800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638316800,"objectID":"fe5fc658a8ef995c1587f58333ad9c02","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/sound2image2/","publishdate":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sound2image2/","section":"publication","summary":"Semantically meaningful image manipulation often involves laborious manual human examination for each desired manipulation. Recent success suggests that leveraging the representation power of existing Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) models with the generative power of StyleGAN can successfully manipulate a given image driven by textual semantics. Following this, we explore adding a new modality, Sound, which can convey a different view of dynamic semantic information and thus can reinforce control strength over the semantic image manipulation. Our audio encoder is trained to produce a latent representation from an audio input, which is forced to be aligned with image and text representations in the same CLIP embedding space. Given such aligned embeddings, we use a direct latent optimization method so that an input image is modified in response to a user-provided sound input. We quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we observe our sound-guided image manipulation approach can produce semantically meaningful images.","tags":[],"title":"Sound-guided Semantic Image Manipulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daehee Kim","Jinkyu Kim","Jaekoo Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638230400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638230400,"objectID":"c02ae23c87d4bd61c19f5b6c94d2e192","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/ictexpress/","publishdate":"2020-11-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ictexpress/","section":"publication","summary":"Domain generalization aims to learn a domain-invariant representation from multiple source domains so that a model can generalize well across unseen target domains.

However, in real-world situations, a difference in the distribution between two datasets, domain shift, may occur, which becomes a major factor impeding the generalization performance of the model. The research field to solve this problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require sampling of the negative data pair. However, the performance of contrastive learning fundamentally depends on quality and quantity of negative data pairs. To address this issue, we propose a new regularization method for domain generalization based on contrastive learning, self-supervised contrastive regularization (SelfReg). The proposed approach use only positive data pairs, thus it resolves various problems caused by negative pair sampling. Moreover, we propose a class-specific domain perturbation layer (CDPL), which makes it possible to effectively apply mixup augmentation even when only positive data pairs are used. The experimental results show that the techniques incorporated by SelfReg contributed to the performance in a compatible manner. In the recent benchmark, DomainBed, the proposed method shows comparable performance to the conventional state-of-the-art alternatives.

Using positive pairs may avoid dealing with computationally demanding negatives, but so-called mode collapse may occur without any implicit biases in the learning architecture. In this paper, we propose a new loss function, called BMWReg, which induces an implicit contrastive effect in the embedding space, effectively preventing a mode collapse. BMWReg consists of the following three regularization terms. (i) a Brownian diffusive loss, which induces a Brownian motion in the embedding space so that embeddings are uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere. (ii) A multi-view centroid loss, which applies an attractive force to pull together multiple augmented representations of the same image into the geometric centroid. (iii) A whitening loss, which decorrelates the different feature dimensions in the latent space. We evaluate BMWReg on two visual benchmarks -- ImageNet-100 and STL-10. In addition, we also show that applying our regularization term to other methods further improves their performance and stabilize the training by preventing a mode collapse.","tags":[],"title":"BMWReg: Brownian-diffusive, Multiview, Whitening Regulararizations for Self-supervised Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinkyu Kim","Mayank Bansal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1618876800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1618876800,"objectID":"7ec3ebfc6af0decc8b073c2da042cfcc","permalink":"https://VisionAI-lab.github.io/publication/attnbot/","publishdate":"2021-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/attnbot/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep neural networks are a key component of behavior prediction and motion generation for self-driving cars. One of their main drawbacks is a lack of transparency -- they should provide easy to interpret rationales for what triggers certain behaviors. We propose an architecture called Attentional Bottleneck with the goal of improving transparency. Our key idea is to combine visual attention, which identifies what aspects of the input the model is using, with an information bottleneck that enables the model to only use aspects of the input which are important. This not only provides sparse and interpretable attention maps (e.g. focusing only on specific vehicles in the scene), but it adds this transparency at no cost to model accuracy. In fact, we find improvements in accuracy when applying Attentional Bottleneck to the ChauffeurNet model, whereas we find that the accuracy deteriorates with a traditional visual attention model.","tags":[],"title":"Towards an Interpretable Deep Driving Network by Attentional Bottleneck","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nelson Bighetti","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
